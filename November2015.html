Next up for the foxes, Watford home and another goal from Jamie Vardy and a first goal from summer signing, midfielder, N’Golo Kante, gave Leicester a 2-1 win.<br><br>
Leicester’s next game was significant for one Leicester player, Jamie Vardy. For the past two months, he has been scoring non-stop and the media started talking about the record.<br><br> 
November 21 2015, the day that Jamie Vardy tied the record.<br><br> 
Leicester’s opponents were Newcastle United. Vardy tied the premier league record by scoring the first goal of the game. Two goals from strikers Leo Ulloa and Shinji Okazaki, gave Leicester a 3-0 win and 3 points.<br><br> 
The build up to the Manchester United game at the King Power Stadium, was all about whether Jamie Vardy would beat former Manchester United striker, Ruud Van Nistelrooy’s record. During the week, Van Nistelrooy wished Vardy luck via social media.<br><br> 
So the game, Manchester United have a corner, crossed in, headed away by a Leicester player. Christian Fuchs, Leicester defender, chargers forward and somehow passes the ball to Jamie Vardy and Vardy scored past Manchester United goalkeeper De Gea.<br><br> 
Jamie Vary breaks the record by scoring in 11 consecutive games.<br><br> 
The end of the month left Leicester second on goal difference to leaders Manchester City.<br><br> 
<b>My Opinions:</b>The run kept going, but November will be remembered for Vardy breaking the record. For a player, who 3 years ago was playing in the fifth tier of English football (Non-League), to breaking the record, it’s an incredible story, and filmmakers were even considering making a film for the Leicester striker.
