March started with a home game against West Brom. The game finished 2-2, the goals coming from midfielder and longest serving player, Andy King and an own goal from West Brom defender Jonas Olsson. It felt like two points dropped, but the following night, Leicester's rivals, Arsenal and Tottenham dropped points in their games, and it felt a relief to Leicester fans.<br><br>
Watford away next for the premier league leaders, where a goal from Riyad Mahrez, gave Leicester a 1-0 win and three points.<br><br> 
Leicester then played Newcastle at home, the goal from Shinji Okazaki gave Leicester another 1-0 win.<br><br> 
Crystal Palace away at Selhurst Park and another 1-0 win, the goal coming from Riyad Mahrez. The game was remembered for the Leicester fans, who stayed for 20 minutes after the game, inside the ground celebrating the victory.<br><br> 
The end of March left Leicester top of the league, 5 points ahead of second place Tottenham and 11 ahead of third placed Arsenal.<br><br> 

<b>My Opinion:</b> At this point, I felt that we just needed to keep this run going till the end. Keeping clean sheets (the 1-0 wins against Newcastle, Watford and Crystal Palace) showed that the Leicester defence were unstoppable.
