<div class = "TextAugust2015">Leicester began the season with a new manager, Claudio Ranieri. Ranieri had previously been the manager of the Greek National Team. The media predicted Leicester to be relegated and they were ranked 5,000/1 to win the Premier League. The new manager, Ranieri, was bookies favourite to be the first manager to be sacked<br><br>So the season started with a home match against Sunderland. Leicester took a 3-0 lead with goals from Jamie Vardy and two goals from Riyad Mahrez. The game ended 4-2, with a goal from Marc Albrighton.
<br><br>Next up, West Ham away, and Leicester’s final visit to Upton Park before West Ham moved to the Olympic Stadium. Leicester won the match 2-1, with goals from Riyad Mahrez and a first Leicester goal for Japanese striker, Shinji Okazaki.<br><br>Leicester’s next two games were against Tottenham at home and Bournemouth away. Both games finished 1-1, with Riyad Mahrez scoring against Tottenham and Jamie Vardy scoring a penalty against Bournemouth. By the end of August, Leicester were 3rd with 8 points, 3 points behind leaders Manchester United. 
<br><br><b>My Opinions:</b> A good unbeaten start to the season.
