I have been a Leicester City fan since 2003, and this is what I have witnessed in the last 14 years:<br><br>

<strong>2004 - Relegation to the Championship</strong><br><br>
<strong>2008 - Relegation to League One (for the first time in Leicester City's history)</strong><br><br>
<strong>2009 - Promotion back to the Championship</strong><br><br>
<strong>2010 - Play Off heartbreak vs Cardiff City</strong><br><br>
<strong>2013 - Play Off heartbreak vs Watford</strong><br><br>
<strong>2014 - Promotion to the Premier League</strong><br><br>
<strong>2015 - Premier League Survival</strong><br><br>
<strong>2016 - Premier League Champions</strong><br><br>

What I experienced last season (2015-2016 season) was and always will be the greatest season to be a Leicester City fan. During the summer of 2015, my team was ranked 5,000/1 to win the Premier League.<br><br>
Not only was winning the Premier League something incredible, but to get into the UEFA Champions League also made the 2015-2016 season special.<br><br>

The aim of this website is to review how Leicester City shocked the football world and won the Premier League. The review will be based on all the league games played between August 2015 and
May 2016,<br> and I will give my views month by month. Also included on the website are the players and staff who were involved during the 2015-2016 season and statistics related.
