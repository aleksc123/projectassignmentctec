I have been a Leicester City fan since 2003, and this is what I have witnessed in the last 14 years:<br><br>

<strong>2004 - Relegation to the Championship</strong><br><br>
<strong>2008 - Relegation to League One (for the first time in LCFCs history)</strong><br><br>
<strong>2009 - Promotion back to the Championship</strong><br><br>
<strong>2010 - Play Off heartbreak vs Cardiff City</strong><br><br>
<strong>2013 - Play Off heartbreak vs Watford</strong><br><br>
<strong>2014 - Promotion to the Premier League</strong><br><br>
<strong>2015 - Premier League Survival</strong><br><br>

But what I experienced last season was and always will be the greatest season to be a Leicester City fan. During the summer of 2015, my team was ranked 5,000/1 to win the Premier League.<br><br>
Not only was winning the premier league something incredible, but to get into the UEFA Champions League also made the 2015-2016 season special.<br><br>

The aim of this website is to review how the team ranked 5,000/1 shocked the football world and won the Premier League. The review will be based on all the league games played between August<br>2015 and
May 2016, and I will give my views month by month. Also included on the website are the players and staff that were involved during the season and player statistics.
