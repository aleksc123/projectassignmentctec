April started with another 1-0 win, this time against Southampton. The goal coming from captain and defender, Wes Morgan.<br><br>
Sunderland away was next and a double from Jamie Vardy and a 2-0 for Leicester, which left them 7 points ahead of second placed Tottenham, the only challengers left for the title. The 2-0 win also secured Leicester a place in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their 132 year history.<br><br>
West Ham next for the Premier League leaders. A game full of controversy. It all started with a goal from Jamie Vardy, 1-0 Leicester. Then, disaster. Leicester’s top scorer was given a second yellow and was sent off. The reason? He was judged to have dived for a penalty. The game turned and West Ham took a 2-1 lead. It looked like Leicester would lose their first home game of 2016. But then Leicester were given a penalty, defender Jeff Schlupp went down and substitute Leo Ulloa scored the penalty. Relief to Leicester fans, but worry that their star striker would now miss the next 2 games.<br><br> 
Swansea next at home, without Jamie Vardy. Was Leicester’s run going to end? Would they collapse?<br><br> 
The final score? 4-0 to Leicester. Two goals from Leo Ulloa, coming in for the suspended Vardy, and a goal for Mahrez and Albrighton. The Leicester fans chanted ‘4-0 to the one man team’. They asked whether Leicester could cope without Vardy? Well? Yes.<br><br>
The next day, rivals Tottenham played West Brom. They needed to win to keep the run for the title going. Tottenham took the lead after an own goal from West Brom’s Craig Dawson. Dawson, who scored the own goal equalised for West Brom. 1-1 the game finished. Leicester fans couldn’t believe it. All Leicester needed to do was beat Manchester United and the title was theirs.<br><br>
Leicester were still top of the league at the end of the month and now looked certain to win the league after Tottenham’s wobble against West Brom. Win against a team that has won the most premier league titles, and they themselves will be Premier League champions for the first time in 135 years.<br><br> 

<b>My Opinion:</b> Nearly there! Just beat Manchester United and we are the champions. When the equaliser was scored by West Brom, I couldn’t believe what I was watching. My team, Leicester City could be Premier League Champions. All we need to do is beat United and we are champions.<br><br>
