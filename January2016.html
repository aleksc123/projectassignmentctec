2016 started with a home match against Bournemouth. Earlier in the season, Leicester drew 1-1. In the reverse fixture, it was another draw, this time 0-0. But the match will be remembered for the missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez.<br><br>
After the 0-0 draw against Bournemouth, Leicester travelled to London to face Tottenham. A goal from a corner for Robert Huth gave Leicester all three points.<br><br>
Aston Villa away next. Leicester striker, Shinji Okazaki scored, thanks to goal line technology. Like the Bournemouth match, this match would be remembered for a missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez. Aston Villa equalised later and the match finished 1-1.<br><br> 
January finished with a 3-0 home win against Stoke. Goals from midfielder Danny Drinkwater, Jamie Vardy and Leo Ulloa gave Leicester the three points.<br><br> 
At the end of January, Leicester were top, 3 points ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal.<br><br> 
<b>My Opinion:</b> Dropped points against Bournemouth and Aston Villa, but a 3-0 well performed win against Stoke. Still top of the leagueâ€¦
