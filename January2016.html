2016 started with a home match against Bournemouth. Earlier in the season, Leicester drew 1-1. In the reverse fixture, it was another draw, this time 0-0. But the match will be remembered for the missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez.<br><br>
After the 0-0 draw against Bournemouth, Leicester travelled to London to face Tottenham. A goal from a corner from defender, Robert Huth gave Leicester all three points.<br><br>
Aston Villa away next at Villa Park. Leicester striker, Shinji Okazaki scored, thanks to goal line technology. Like the Bournemouth match, this match would be remembered for another missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez. Aston Villa equalised later and the match finished 1-1.<br><br> 
January finished with a 3-0 home win against Stoke. Goals from midfielder Danny Drinkwater, Jamie Vardy and Leo Ulloa gave Leicester the three points.<br><br> 
At the end of January, Leicester were top, 3 points ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal.<br><br> 
<b>My Opinion:</b> Dropped points against Bournemouth and Aston Villa, but a 3-0 well performed win against Stoke. Still top of the leagueâ€¦
