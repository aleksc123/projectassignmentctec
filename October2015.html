October started with an away game at Norwich, where Leicester won 2-1, thanks to goals from defender, Jeff Schlupp and striker, Jamie Vardy. Southampton away next, and like the Stoke and Aston Villa games, Leicester 2-0 down. But two goals from Jamie Vardy gained Leicester a well-deserved point.<br><br>
Manager Claudio Ranieri promised to treat his squad with pizza, if they kept a clean sheet in one of Leicester’s games. Leicester’s next game was against Crystal Palace, where Leicester won 1-0, with another goal from Jamie Vardy. Pizza secured for the squad.<br><br>
This was Vardy's 7th consecutive game where he scored, and the media was questioning whether Vardy could break Van Nistelrooy’s goalscoring record of scoring in 10 consecutive games.<br><br>
On Halloween, Leicester faced West Brom at The Hawthorns. West Brom took the lead, and two goals from Riyad Mahrez and a goal from Jamie Vardy, gave Leicester a 3-1 lead. West Brom did score a penalty with six minutes to go, but Leicester held on to win 3-2 win.
The end of the month left Leicester 3rd, below leaders Manchester City and second placed Arsenal.<br><br> 
<b>My Opinions:</b>  Great comeback against Southampton and a good run after wins against Palace and West Brom.
