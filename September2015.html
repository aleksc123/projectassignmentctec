<div class = "TextSeptember2015">September began with a home match against Aston Villa. Leicester won the game 3-2 after coming back from 2-0 down, with goals from defender Ritchie De Laet, Jamie Vardy and new signing, Nathan Dyer. All three goals were scored within 17 minutes. An incredible comeback.<br><br>
Stoke away next. Stoke take a 2-0 lead. But, goals from Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez and the match ends 2-2. The final game of September was a 2-5 defeat against Arsenal. Both Leicester goals scored by Jamie Vardy<br><br>The end of the month left Leicester 7th in the league with 12 points. 
<br><br><b>My Opinions:</b> Good comebacks from the games against Aston Villa and Stoke, disappointing loss against Arsenal, where Leicester played well in the first half of the match.
